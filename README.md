The Mobile Pet Spa CLI System is a command-line application that allows users to select and order pet care services. It features a menu of ten services, customer input handling, and an order summary with total pricing. Users can identify as regular or premium customers, with premium customers receiving a 10% discount. The system uses functions for service display, order input, and summarization, along with object-oriented classes (Customer, PremiumCustomer, and OrderSummary) to organize data and logic. It's designed for simplicity and ease of use in a text-based environment.
